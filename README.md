# DevOps Cloud Automation Project

## Project Title
Automated Cloud Infrastructure Deployment and Monitoring using DevOps

## Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing an end-to-end DevOps pipeline to automate provisioning, deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of a cloud-based web application. The goal is to improve deployment reliability, scalability, and performance using DevOps best practices.

## Tools & Technologies
- Version Control: Git, GitHub
- CI/CD: Jenkins
- Containerization: Docker, Docker Compose
- Cloud Platform: AWS (EC2, IAM, Security Groups)
- Web Server: Nginx (Reverse Proxy)
- Backend: Python (Flask)
- Databases: MySQL (SQL), MongoDB (NoSQL)
- Scripting: Bash
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana
- Networking: Linux networking, ports, firewalls
- Caching: Application-level caching

## System Architecture
1. Source code is managed using GitHub.
2. Jenkins automates build, test, and deployment pipelines.
3. Docker is used to containerize the application.
4. Application is deployed on AWS EC2 instances.
5. Nginx acts as a reverse proxy and manages traffic.
6. SQL and NoSQL databases store application data.
7. Monitoring tools track system performance and application health.

## Key Features
- Automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins
- Cloud-based deployment on AWS
- Containerized application using Docker
- Reverse proxy configuration using Nginx
- SQL and NoSQL database integration
- Automated server provisioning using Bash scripts
- Monitoring and performance optimization

## Project Status
In Progress:
- Architecture and workflow designed
- CI/CD pipeline structure defined
- Cloud infrastructure setup in progress
- Monitoring and optimization modules under implementation

## Future Enhancements
- Load balancing using Nginx
- Auto-scaling on AWS
- Centralized logging
- Advanced monitoring and alerting
